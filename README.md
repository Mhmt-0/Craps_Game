# Craps_Game_Example

# In this example, it shows the software functioning of a craps game taking place in the background. Craps is a game played with two dice rolled. The most important rule in this game is the sum of the dice rolled in turn. According to the rule, the sum of the two dice rolled is taken. Whoever rolls the larger dice, the bet he is playing is multiplied by the sum of the dice, and the person who rolls the larger dice wins. Today, the principle of operation of these and similar betting games is almost the same. First, a user becomes a member of these websites. After becoming a member, the daily bet amount that will be valid for your account for twenty-four hours is defined. And with the daily limit included in the account, a person can bet on himself. Even if he finishes the daily limit, he can transfer money from his bank account to his betting account and continue betting. From the betting game in this software example, there is a situation similar to real-life betting sites. The person determines the bet according to the money he has deposited from his account. A person is faced with the question of whether he will continue to win or lose the bet he made, and this choice is made by the person's own will. When he loses, the bet he lost is deducted from his account. When he wins, the bet he won is immediately transferred to his account.
