# Craps_Game_Example

# In this example, it shows the software functioning of a craps game taking place in the background. Craps is a game played with two dice thrown. The most important rule in this game is the sum of the dice rolled sequentially. According to the rule, the sum of the two dice thrown is taken. Whoever rolls the bigger dice, the bet he is playing is multiplied by the sum of the dice, and the person who rolls the bigger dice wins. Nowadays, the principle of operation of this and similar betting games is almost the same. First, a user becomes a member of these Internet sites. After becoming a member, the daily bet amount is defined to your account, which will be valid for twenty-four hours. And a person can bet on himself with the daily limit included in the hesbina. Even if he finishes the daily limit, he can transfer money from his bank account to his betting account and continue betting. There is a similar situation from the betting game in this software example to the betting sites in real life. The person determines the bet according to the money placed from his account. A person is faced with the question of whether he will continue whether he wins or loses the bet he made, and this choice is made by the person's own will. When he loses, the bet he lost is deducted from his account. When he wins, the bet he won is transferred to his account instantly.
